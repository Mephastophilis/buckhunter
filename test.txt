THIS IS THE SAMPLE TEXT DATABASE FOR THE YELP REIVEWS.

Food was really great.

Service was spotty, soup that was ordered was forgotten about  until we reminded the waitress.  It came out about 2 minutes before our entrees.

It was also hard to get a refill on water.

I would come back to this location over the TROY location though as it is a smaller venue and you don't seem as crammed in.


This is easily the worst P. F. Chang's ever. Been to the ones at Detroit Airport, Salt Lake City, even Rogers, Arkansas. All great.

Ordered the standard spicy chicken, which arrived warm with a glue-like coating. Seriously, I don't think they know how to cook here, or maybe the woks are on strike.

After many visits of never having basic modifications to menu items being a problem, we were told that sushi was unable to be modified to remove ingredients because "management is really starting to crack down on that."

Our server went to bat for us but management wouldn't budge. It's not like the restaurant was very busy or we were asking for anything exceptionally difficult.

Very disappointing. Won't be returning to this location anytime soon.

Been a long time since been to P.F. Chang's and have not been to this new location. I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend!

Came on a Saturday but late around 730p-8p and the restaurant was packed but not too packed. There were a couple homecoming groups. We did not have reservations but only had to wait about 10 minutes to get seated. The décor is sleek, comfortable, and intimate.

Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. Great customer service! The mango ice tea is excellent and has 0 calories, so even better. She was on point with getting us refills.

The egg drop soup is a must! It came out hot and yummy. Great flavors and not your typical thick/bright yellow egg drop soup but this tasted fresh.

The menu suggests sharing entrees but unfortunately my hubby and I do not agree when it comes to protein. Therefore, I went with the kung pao shrimp and he got the pepper steak. We tried to be calorie conscious and both entrees were less than 800 calories. Pretty difficult to eat healthy here but they do have some entrees that are lighter with the calories.

Our entrees were delicious and had excellent flavors. My kung pao shrimp had a kick to it but I could've had it even spicier. The white rice was fluffy and nice addition to my entrée. My husband was happy with his pepper steak along with the veggies that came with it.

I got a to-go and our waitress gave me a new and full box of white rice which was very nice. Very happy with my experience here and cannot wait to go back and try something else.

P.F. Chang's is Chinese food for ladies that have regular yoga classes, salon appointments and a collection of designer purses. So you're wondering why I ate there? Well, you've obviously never seen me in yoga pants at the Coach Outlet store with my nails and hair done did doe.

That being said, there is a nice Chinese bistro ambiance here. A dim lit, adult atmosphere with high end decor and soft funky non-Chinese music. You can make having Chinese food without actually seeing a Chinese person a bit more of an upscale experience here which is not all that common of a find in metro Detroit admittedly. My personal favorites for apps are the yummy ground chicken lettuce wraps (tasty, healthy, low carb) and calamari. The former being the better shareable portioned option, and the latter being a typical yet solid flash fried salt & pepper calamari. I will say the calamari tends to be a bit skimpy on protein portion. PF Chang's soups are also on point. I personally prefer egg drop but I know the other options all look good.

Entree wise I have always been a fan of ordering the Kung Pao Chicken, spicy with extra blackened red chili peppers and peanuts. It is truly a superior Kung Pao experience compared to ordering Kung Pao at your corner wing wong carry out.

Good, semi-upscale feeling Chinese bistro without breaking the bank. Not huge portions - but if you are valet parking your leased Mercedes SUV to eat Chinese food - you will end up being very happy with what you get and pay for. 1 1/2 thumbs up!

My husband and I visited the Rochester hills location last night 8/12/18 for our very first time ever at P.F. Chang's. I'm only giving it the 1 star rating because, our waitress was great and tried to help make the experience good (until the end then we felt judged). & Our appetizer was really good.

We first ordered the tempura calamari- that was AMAZING! (So we figured our entrees would be great, boy were we wrong)

My husband ordered the surf and turf, he said the filet was chewy, and the tempura shrimp & lobster where flavorless. He also ordered fried rice with his meal, as he began eating he noticed everything had a sweet taste to it. Definitely wasn't expecting that.

I ordered the Hokkien Street Noodles based on the reviews from yelp and the pictures it looked amazing! Well what I got was absolutely no shrimp (even the waitress said she didn't know where the shrimp was but, didn't try to make it right.) I'm 100% sure the chicken they put in my food was tofu. It was rubbery & had absolutely no taste. I also ordered the fried rice which I thought was pretty yummy, and the chicken egg rolls also yummy and had actual chicken in it.

When I brought the "chicken" from my food to my waitresses attention she first told us that's what they always use (even though all the pictures on yelp shows something completely different), then when I asked her how tofu looked she said basically like what's on my plate. So at this point I'm frustrated and all we could do was laugh because, she didn't realize what she said. She then told us that we ordered bold items for it being our first time here so next time order something more simple. (I didn't know surf & turf was bold, & my only issue with my plate was the no shrimp & the TOFU).

She boxed up our food even though my husband didn't even want to take any of his food home. She then asked about what we wanted for dessert because she needed to make sure we like something before we left, we told her we would try the Great Wall of chocolate that turned out to be pretty good.

We got our bill and we were most definitely taken back by how much it was. We just started laughing because, we weren't expecting the bill to be that much. (104$ prior to tip & also surprised we were paying for dessert considering she said she was trying to make it right). So we give her our gift card we got as a wedding gift and then my husband gives her his debit card to cover the rest. She then proceeds to say "I know our food is expensive, are you sure you don't want me to get the manager to take something off since you didn't like your food." My husband and I looked at each other and instantly said no. At that moment we definitely felt judge. 104$ was NOT an expensive bill to us, we spend more than that at other restaurants. Our issue with the bill being 104$ was the fact that our entrees were absolutely HORRIBLE.

Needless to say we left there feeling like our waitress thought we couldn't afford our bill & only complained to her about the entrees to get them taken off. (Thank god we said no to seeing the manager). We definitely will never return to this location or another P.F. Chang's again. I would definitely reconsider try this place if you've never been.

Listen, I like PF Chang's. But there is something about this location that just always sets a negative tone. The food is fine, but the service is always a bit off, and how the check-in/front desk is managed just seems off. Not particularly friendly given the 30 people that always seem to be waiting. For better or worse, there is always a giant wait. It also seems crowded -- like you're too close to everyone. Feels like they fit a 100% restaurant into a 90% space. The bar takes up a massive amount of room, but when I've been there it always seem empty, maybe start by re-configuring that space? Not sure if the bar is more lucrative than the dinning area but PF Chang's is not about "bar" it is about Asian fusion food. If I just rated it based on food, I'd say 4 at least, maybe even 5 as you get just what you expect. But I just feel negative ju ju every time we visit. Not sure how else to say it.

Service sucks at this location! Ordered Egg Drop soup and got a mean glance from the wait staff as they wanted me to get more food. We never saw the waitress or her trainee, yes the bad service gets worse...during our meal. No refills and waited 10 minutes for a box and our check. There were plenty of staff rolling silverware but none in the lunch area. Tables sat unbused our entire meal. Do not go to the Rochester location!
